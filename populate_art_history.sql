(1, 'Foundations of Art History as a Discipline', 'Art history is the academic study of art objects in their historical development and stylistic contexts. It is distinct from art appreciation (subjective enjoyment) and art criticism (contemporary evaluation).

**Key Concepts:**
- **Connoisseurship**: The ability to attribute artworks to specific artists based on style, technique, and quality. Developed by Bernard Berenson and others. Focus on the ''eye'' and detailed visual analysis.

- **Taste**: The formation of aesthetic judgment, which is historically and culturally determined. What counts as ''good art'' changes over time.

- **Canon**: The established body of artworks considered most important. Traditionally Eurocentric and male-dominated; now being challenged and expanded.

- **Style**: The distinctive visual characteristics of an artist, period, or movement. Can be used to date and attribute works.

- **Evidence and Analysis**: Art historians use primary sources (the artworks themselves) and secondary sources (documents, texts, historical records) to build interpretations.

**Historical Development:**
The discipline emerged in the 18th-19th centuries with scholars like Winckelmann and Vasari. It has evolved from biographical and connoisseurial approaches to include social history, feminist analysis, and cultural studies.

**Current Debates:**
- What counts as ''art''? (high art vs. popular culture)
- Whose art matters? (canon expansion, inclusion of women artists, non-Western traditions)
- How should we interpret art? (formalist, contextual, theoretical approaches)', 'framework', 1, datetime('now'));

(1, 'Approaches to Studying Art', 'Art historians use various methodological frameworks:

**1. Formalism/Aesthetic Analysis**
- Focus on visual elements: line, color, composition, form
- Pioneered by Heinrich Wölfflin, Roger Fry
- Emphasis on ''art for art''s sake''
- Critique: Ignores social/historical context

**2. Iconography and Iconology**
- Iconography: Study of subject matter and symbols
- Iconology: Interpretation of deeper cultural meanings
- Key scholars: Aby Warburg, Erwin Panofsky, Ernst Gombrich
- Essential for religious art, allegories, mythology

**3. Social Art History (Marxist Approach)**
- Art as reflection of economic and class structures
- Focus on patronage, production, and consumption
- Considers art as ideology
- Key influence: Karl Marx''s historical materialism

**4. Feminist Art History**
- Questions gender bias in canon and scholarship
- Studies representation of women vs. women as artists
- Key figures: Linda Nochlin, Griselda Pollock, Rozsika Parker
- Challenges: "Why have there been no great women artists?"

**5. Psychoanalytic Approaches**
- Uses Freudian/Jungian concepts to interpret art
- Examines artist''s unconscious, viewer''s response
- Key figure: Sigmund Freud''s analysis of Leonardo

**6. Semiotics/Structuralism**
- Art as system of signs to be decoded
- Influenced by linguistics (Ferdinand de Saussure)
- Focus on how meaning is constructed

**7. Post-Colonial and Global Approaches**
- Critiques Western-centric narratives
- Examines art in context of colonialism and power
- Values non-Western traditions on their own terms', 'framework', 2, datetime('now'));

INSERT INTO class_corpus (class_id, title, content, type, order_index, created_at) VALUES
(1, 'From Vasari to the New Art History', '**Ancient and Renaissance Foundations:**
- Pliny the Elder (23-79 CE): ''Natural History'' - described ancient Greek/Roman art
- Giorgio Vasari (1511-1574): ''Lives of the Artists'' - biographical approach, emphasis on genius and progress toward naturalism
- Focus on individual artists and the idea of artistic evolution

**18th Century Developments:**
- Johann Joachim Winckelmann (1717-1768): Systematic chronological study, idealization of Greek art as pinnacle
- Introduced idea of historical periods with rise and decline

**19th Century Expansion:**
- G.W.F. Hegel: Art as manifestation of ''world spirit'' (Zeitgeist and Volksgeist)
- Jacob Burckhardt: Cultural history approach in ''Civilisation of Renaissance Italy'' (1860)
- Development of museums and public art education

**Early 20th Century:**
- Roger Fry: Formalist criticism, coined ''Post-Impressionism''
- Clement Greenberg: Modernist criticism, emphasis on medium specificity and abstraction
- Aby Warburg & Erwin Panofsky: Iconological method

**Late 20th Century - New Art History:**
- 1970s-80s: Introduction of critical theory
- Feminist interventions (Nochlin, Pollock, Parker)
- Social and Marxist approaches
- Post-colonial critiques
- Incorporation of popular culture and visual studies

**21st Century Directions:**
- Global art histories

(1, 'How Art is Presented and Consumed', '**History of Collecting:**
- Ancient: Religious offerings, princely collections (e.g., Emperor Hadrian''s villa)
- Renaissance: Cabinet of curiosities, papal collections (Vatican)
- 18th century: Grand Tour, increased collecting by wealthy Europeans
- Late 18th century: Public museums emerge (Louvre 1793)

**Functions of Museums:**
1. **Preservation**: Protect art for future generations
2. **Display**: Make art accessible to public
3. **Education**: Teach art history and aesthetic appreciation
4. **Legitimation**: Confer status on what counts as ''art''
5. **National Identity**: Express cultural values and prestige

**Display Strategies:**
- **Chronological**: Traditional linear narrative (e.g., Musée d''Orsay)
- **Thematic**: Group by subject matter or concept (e.g., Tate Modern)
- **Monographic**: Single artist or movement rooms
- **Period Rooms**: Recreate historical contexts

**Critical Issues:**
- Museums present a selective ''history'' that reflects present concerns
- What is included/excluded reveals ideology and power structures
- Colonial acquisition and repatriation debates
- Whose art is shown? (gender, race, geography)
- Impact on interpretation: the ''white cube'' effect

**The Art Market:**
- Auction houses, dealers, galleries
- Economic value vs. artistic value
- Role of critics and curators in establishing reputations
- How artworks become commodities', 'concept', 4, datetime('now'));

(1, 'Visual Literacy and Analysis', '**Levels of Meaning:**

**1. Representational/Literal**
- What do we see? (subject matter, figures, objects)
- Recognition of conventional representations

**2. Iconographic**
- Symbols and attributes (e.g., lily = purity, laurel = Apollo)
- Knowledge of religious, mythological, historical narratives
- Cultural and temporal specificity

**3. Iconological**
- Deeper cultural meanings and values
- Art as expression of broader ideas (philosophy, ideology)
- Context of production and reception

**Formal Analysis Elements:**
- **Line**: Contour, direction, movement
- **Color**: Hue, value, saturation, temperature
- **Composition**: Arrangement, balance, focus
- **Space**: Perspective, depth, flatness
- **Light**: Chiaroscuro, highlighting, shadows
- **Texture**: Surface quality, brushwork
- **Scale**: Size relationships

**Contextual Considerations:**
- **Historical context**: When and where was it made?
- **Patronage**: Who commissioned it and why?
- **Function**: What was its original purpose?
- **Artist''s intention** (if knowable) vs. viewer''s interpretation
- **Medium and technique**: How does materiality affect meaning?
- **Reception history**: How has it been interpreted over time?

**Close Looking Practice:**
1. Describe what you see (observation)
2. Analyze formal elements and composition
3. Identify subject matter and symbols
4. Research historical/cultural context
5. Interpret meanings (multiple perspectives possible)
6. Evaluate and support your interpretation with evidence', 'guideline', 5, datetime('now'));

(1, 'Connoisseurship and Attribution', 'Connoisseurship is the practice of identifying, authenticating, and evaluating artworks based on detailed visual analysis. Bernard Berenson (1865-1959) was a famous connoisseur who attributed Italian Renaissance paintings based on style, technique, brushwork, and compositional choices.

The connoisseur''s ''eye'' is developed through extensive looking and comparison. Key elements examined include:
- Brushwork and paint handling
- Drawing style and anatomical treatment
- Compositional habits
- Color palette preferences
- Technical execution

Limitations: Can be subjective, based on ''intuition,'' and has historically excluded women and non-Western art from serious study. Modern scientific analysis (X-rays, pigment analysis) complements traditional connoisseurship.', 'concept', 1, datetime('now'));

(1, 'The Canon and Its Critics', 'The canon is the body of artworks considered most important, valuable, and worthy of study. Traditionally dominated by:
- European (especially Italian, French, Dutch) art
- Male artists
- ''High'' art (painting, sculpture) over ''low'' art (crafts, decorative arts)
- Realistic representation over abstraction or non-Western aesthetics

**Challenges to the Canon:**
- Feminist art historians (1970s+): Questioned exclusion of women artists
- Post-colonial scholars: Critiqued Eurocentric bias
- Visual culture studies: Expanded to include popular culture, design, advertising
- Global art history: Values non-Western traditions on their own terms

Example: Judy Chicago''s ''The Dinner Party'' challenged the canon by celebrating 1,038 women in history through a collaborative installation using ''feminine'' crafts (embroidery, ceramics) previously excluded from ''high art.''', 'concept', 2, datetime('now'));

(1, 'Art Appreciation vs. Art History vs. Art Criticism', '**Art Appreciation:**
- Subjective, personal response to art
- Focus on enjoyment and aesthetic pleasure
- Individual taste and preferences
- No systematic methodology required

**Art History:**
- Academic discipline studying art in historical context
- Uses evidence-based analysis
- Considers style, iconography, patronage, social factors
- Aims for scholarly interpretation with supporting evidence

**Art Criticism:**
- Evaluation of contemporary art
- Judgment of quality and significance
- Influences taste and market value
- Examples: Clement Greenberg on Abstract Expressionism, Roger Fry on Post-Impressionism

All three are valid but serve different purposes. Art historians may use elements of criticism and certainly experience aesthetic appreciation, but the discipline requires rigorous methodology and historical contextualization.', 'definition', 3, datetime('now'));
